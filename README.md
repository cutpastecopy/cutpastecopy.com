## About Cut, Paste & Copy
Cut, Paste & Copy is a student run graphic design business. We use several of the Adobe Creative Suite programs, such as, Photoshop, Illustrator, and inDesign. To practice our graphic design skills, we reach out to the community for real world experience. For our past community projects we have created business cards, t- shirt designs, posters, booklets, and more.
